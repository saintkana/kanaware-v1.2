# KanaWare v1.2

KanaWare v1.2 is a **personal utility toolbox** made up of small Python and VBScript programs that automate simple tasks, display messages, and launch applications.

This repository is not a single monolithic application — it’s a collection of scripts created to experiment with automation, scripting, and basic system utilities.

---

## 📌 Purpose

The purpose of this project is to:

- Practice **Python scripting** and basic automation
- Experiment with **VBScript** for system messages and simple interactions
- Build small tools that solve personal, real-world problems
- Serve as a sandbox for learning and iteration

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** — main scripting language
- **VBScript** — simple message pop-ups and automation
- Basic file handling and script execution

---

## 📂 Project Structure

Each file is mostly **standalone** and performs a specific task. Examples include:

- Script launchers and menu files  
- Utility scripts (e.g. network or system-related tools)  
- Message / alert scripts using VBScript  

Because scripts were created at different times for different purposes, functionality varies between files.
